Orchestrate the complete implementation of voice replies.

Read docs/specs/voice-replies/implementation/README.md and plan.md. Do not read the
specification, task packets, diffs or findings; the workstream leads own those.

Create the branch `voice-replies` from the current HEAD and record its base in the plan.

Then loop: read the plan, spawn a workstream lead for the next workstream passing only its packet
path. The lead records its own status, drift and escalation before committing, so read its return
only to decide whether to continue or stop. Wait for each lead in one blocking call. Do not
busy-poll a running agent.

If a row is in a non-terminal state and has no live lead, start a fresh lead for that workstream
and tell it to recover the uncommitted work using the README's recovery rules.

After the last workstream is accepted, spawn the final-review lead documented in the README.

Report to the user at each workstream acceptance, on an escalation, and in the completion report
covering delivered work, verification, external validation pending, and specification drift. Do
not narrate progress otherwise.

When a lead returns Blocked, read only the escalation entry it names in plan.md, put that
question to the user, record the answer in the entry, and start a fresh lead for that workstream.

The leads run reviews through the review command named in the workflow README.

Workstreams 3 and 5 end in an external validation gate. A lead blocking on a gate needs an answer
from the user. Surface its escalation entry, record the answer there, then start a fresh lead for
that workstream.

Continue autonomously. Ask only when a lead blocks.

Execute the workflow now rather than restating it.
